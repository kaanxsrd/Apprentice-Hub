# The Apprentice Hub
**The Apprentice Hub** is a learning platform and portfolio built from my apprenticeship as an software developer.

The website collects all my projects and assignments in one place, where users can:
- **📖 Read** about each project
- **💻 View the source code** directly in the browser
- **⚡ Test and interact** with selected projects (web apps, APIs, WinForms demos)


## 📂 Projects Included:
1. **Portfolio** – Overview of my work and learning journey
2. **C# Basics** – Fundamental exercises
3. **C# Calculator** – Simple calculator application
4. **OOP Console Game** – Small game demonstrating object-oriented programming
5. **SQL Assignment** – Database queries and schema practice
